# Intro to Python for Data Science Workshop - Spring 2018
Instructor: Fernando Rodriguez

Thursdays, 11am-12pm


This workshop will teach you all of the essential Python programming concepts you need in order work with data. We will specifically learn how to work with student clickstream data, which you can think of timestamped events of student's mouse clicks within a Learning Management System (LMS).

We will be using Python for Informatics by Charles Severance for the workshop readings. 
You can find a PDF version of the book <a href="http://www.pythonlearn.com/book_270.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

To access the workshop lessons, open the Jupyter notebook files (e.g., Session2.ipynb) within this repository. I will upload the notebooks after the end of each session. 

If you cannot open the Jupyter notebook files within this repository, you can view them here:</br>
